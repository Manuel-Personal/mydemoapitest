PROJECT STRUCTURE/DIRECTORIES
=============================

Features - contains the feature files for the selected API calls. These were broken down into 3 different files, namely, for the Users, Register, and Login APIs.<br>
Steps - contains all the step definitions for all used steps in the feature files.<br>
Utility - contains classes necessary for performing the API calls, utility functions for string processing, and JSON file to handle string constants.<br>

HOW TO RUN THE TESTS
====================

UI - Make sure you have **Test Explorer** in view. You can specify which tests to run by selecting them from the menu. To run the selected tests, simply click on the **Run** button. Alternatively, you can press **Ctrl+R, T**. Tests that pass will then be marked by a green tick icon. If it fails, a red X icon will be displayed instead. The details of the test whether it passes or fails will then be displayed at the bottom of the Test Explorer view.

Console - The tests can also be run via console. Input the command **"dotnet test"**. After the tests are run, it should display a summary of which tests have passed or failed.

**Settings.json** - so far only contains the URL that hosts the API calls, but any other hardcoded settings should be placed here.


RUNTIME
=======
API tests are usually very quick. For this project, average run time is just 5 seconds.
